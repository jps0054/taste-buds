    INSTRUCTIONS


INSTRUCTIONS
 Remove and save the tops of the
 peppers. Core and seed peppers.
 Blanch peppers and tops in boiling 
 water for 5 minutes. This makes them 
 tender.
 In a large pot, bring the water and salt 
 to a boil. Add the pasta and cook
 uncovered, stirring occasionally until 
 pasta is al dente, about 6 to 8 minutes. 
 Drain well.
 Combine the hot, cooked pasta with
 11/2 cups (375 mL) of the spaghetti 
 sauce, Parmesan cheese, chives, oregano, 
 pepper flakes, salt and pepper.
 Stuff each pepper with the pasta mixture.
 Top each pepper with grated mozzarella
 cheese and replace the pepper lids.
 Stand the peppers in a baking dish and
 pour the remaining sauce around them.
 Cover the dish with foil and bake at 
 375°F (190°C) for 30 minutes, or until 
 tender but not limp. Serve immediately.
Orchichetti are very small disk-shaped
 pasta, "little ears". If you cannot find
 them, substitute baby pasta shells.
