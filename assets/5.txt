INSTRUCTIONS
 Crush 2 cases of grapes and cook the
 pulp and juice for 5 minutes. Mix the
 hot grapes into the cold crushed 
 grapes. Press the grape mixture into a 
 large barrel called a gallon. Let it
 ferment for at least 6 days in a cool, 
 dark place, 20 to 40°F (-6 to 5°C).
 Pour the wine into a fresh gallon slowly, 
 so that the sediment from the bottom 
 does not go into the new gallon.
 Fill the new container right to the neck
 and then add a 1/2" (1.3cm) of olive oil, 
 so that the wine does not breath.
 Seal with a cork and let sit for 4 months.
 After 4 months, open the cork and
 siphon the oil off of the top carefully,
 so that it does not mix with the wine.
 The wine is now ready to drink.
 Yield: 1 barrel/48 gallons (189 L).
