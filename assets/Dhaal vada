Following is the thread test (tar) to check required consistency of syrup (chashni). If no thread is formed, but
there is stickiness in the syrup when tested, then it is 3/4 tar (thread). This consistency is generally used in
dipping sweets like, gulabjamoon, boondi, jalebi, imarti, etc. Boil some more and when 1 tar forms, it is used
in soaking pancake pancakes like malpua. On further boiling two tars are obtained and this is used in sweets
like burfis, mohanthal, etc. At this stage a drop of syrup dropped on a plate will form a soft ball when cooled.
After this stage do no stir briskly and continuously or the sugar will recrystallise. Still further boiling will form
2 1/2 to 3 tars and this syrup is used to get a white coating of sugar on sweets like balushahi, surti ghari, etc.
At this stage when the syrup is dropped in a plate it will form a hard ball when cooled. Following are the steps
shown to make sugar syrup (chashni) in the right way.
a.Take sugar and water in the ratio of 2 : 1 1/2 unless other wise mentioned.
b.Put both in a deep saucepan to boil, stirring occasionally.
c.When the mixture comes to a boil, add 1/2 cup milk.
d.When a thick scum is formed on the surface of syrup, it is time to strain.
e.Always use a metal strainer or moist cloth to strain the hot syrup, never plastic.
f.Put back to boil, checking the consistency required as above.
g.Check frequently, because once the first thread forms, it proceeds to thicken to the next stages very quickly.
h.Use as required in the recipe. Make syrup side by side of making the recipe, reheating the syrup too many
times will alter the texture of the resulting sweet dish. To save time, prepare the syrup on a second burner,
while making the rest of the recipe. This will avoid excess wastage of time and unnecessary cooling off, of the
fried flours, etc. as the recipe demands.
