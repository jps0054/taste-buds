Spicy Roti
-----------------------------
    1 1/2 cups wheat flour
    1/2 cups gram flour
   1 1/2 tsp chilli powder
   1 tbsp oil
   salt to taste
   1/2 turmeric powder
   2-3 pinches asafaetida
   1/2 tsp each cummin / oregano seeds
   finely chopped coriander
   1 tbsp water
   
-----------------------------

   Knead a slightly stiff dough, adding all above ingredients, cover with wet cloth. Break off bits and make
small potato sized balls. Roll to 3-4
   mm thickness. Roast on griddle (tawa) as for phulka. Or after brown spots appear place direct on gas flame
and puff, with help of tongs.
   Phulka also may be done similarly if puffing with cloth, feels difficult. Apply ghee or butter and serve hot
with sweetened mango preserve
   (chunda) or curds or jam.
