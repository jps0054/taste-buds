INSTRUCTIONS
Cook the pasta in an abundance of 
 boiling, salted water.
While pasta is cooking, heat the garlic 
 in 1/3 cup oil in a frying pan over low 
 heat.
When the mixture just begins to
 bubble, stir and cook for a few more 
 minutes until garlic just begins to turn 
 golden. Do not let garlic brown.
When pasta is partially cooked, drain 
 it, add it to the frying pan and toss well.
Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Add a bit more oil if you like.
Serve immediately with Parmesan 
 cheese.
